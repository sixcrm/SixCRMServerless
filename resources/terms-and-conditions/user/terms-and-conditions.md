Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the Agreement, and any of its rights hereunder, in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or stock sale, merger or other corporate reorganization resulting in a change of control, with the consent of the other party, which should not be unreasonably withheld.

* **16.** **Entire Agreement; Construction; Modification**

The Agreement represents the complete and entire expression of the agreement between the Parties, and shall supersede any and all other agreements, whether written or verbal, between the Parties. The Agreement shall be construed as if both Parties equally participated in its drafting, and thus shall not be construed against the drafter.  Six CRM reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time and may add to, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time.  In the event of any material change, Six CRM will notify Subscriber via e-mail or other method of contact through the Service at least three (3) days prior to any such changes taking effect, at which time Subscriber may either agree to such changes or withdraw from the Services. If Subscriber continues to use the Services after receiving notice of the change, Subscriber will be deemed to have accepted the change. .

* **17.** **Non-Waiver; Severability**

No waiver of any breach of any provision of the Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving Party. If any provision contained in the Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the real intention of the Parties, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

* **18.** **Status of the Parties; Subcontracting**
  * **18.1** The Parties hereto are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, agency, employment, franchise or joint venture between the Parties. Neither Party has the authority to bind the other or incur any obligation on its behalf.
  * **18.2** Six CRM expressly reserves the right to subcontract, at Six CRM&#39;s expense, for the performance of any and all of the services to be provided under this Agreement. In such event, however, the rights and obligations of Six CRM and Subscriber shall not be diminished; and provided further that, for any subcontractor engaged by Six CRM to perform the applicable services, Six CRM shall remain responsible for (i) such subcontractor&#39;s compliance with the terms and conditions of the this Agreement; and (ii) such subcontractor&#39;s acts or omissions, as if undertaken by Six CRM.

* **19.** **Force Majeure**

With the exception of Subscriber&#39;s contractual payment of Fees obligation, neither party shall be liable for delays or failure to perform the Services or the Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control. Such delays include, but are not limited to, fire, explosion, flood or other natural catastrophe, governmental legislation, acts, orders or regulations, strikes or labor difficulties, to the extent not occasioned by the fault or negligence of the delayed party. Any such excuse for delay shall last only as long as the event remains beyond the reasonable control of the delayed party. However, the Party whose performance is so delayed shall use commercially-reasonable, good-faith efforts to minimize the effects of such delay and shall resume performance as soon as practicable.

* **20.** **Notices**

Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices or other communications related to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by (a) personal service; (b) electronic mail (to the email address appearing in the signature blocks below); or (c) United States certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid to the mailing addresses appearing in the signature blocks below. Notice given by personal service or via email shall be deemed effective on the date it is delivered to the addressee, and notice mailed shall be deemed effective five (5) days after the date of mailing.

* **21.** **Headings**

The inclusion of headings in this Agreement is for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation hereof.

**EXHIBIT A**

**Service Level Terms**

The Services shall be available for processing transactions 99.9% of the time, measured monthly, excluding holidays and weekends and scheduled maintenance. If Subscriber requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance. Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections, vendors and/or utilities or other reasons beyond Six CRM&#39;s control will also be excluded from any such calculation.

Subscriber&#39;s sole and exclusive remedy, and Six CRM&#39;s entire liability, in connection with the Services availability for processing transactions shall be the following Service Level Credits:

| Total Service Unavailability Time in a Month (&quot;Downtime&quot;) | Downtime Credit |
| --- | --- |
| 99.9% - 100.0% | 0% |
| 99.5% - 99.8% | 2% of monthly fees |
| 99.0% - 99.4% | 5% of monthly fees |
| 98.5% - 98.9% | 10% of monthly fees |
| 98.0$ - 98.4% | 15% of monthly fees |
| Less than 98.0% | 20% of monthly fees |

Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as Subscriber (with notice to Six CRM) recognizes that downtime for the processing of transactions is taking place, and continues until the availability of the Services to process transactions is restored. In order to receive a Downtime Credit, Subscriber must notify Six CRM in writing as soon as practicable following its becoming aware of the Downtime, but in no event longer than twenty-four (24) hours from the start of Downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive a Downtime Credit.  Such credits may not be redeemed for cash.

Six CRM&#39;s blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of Six CRM to provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.



**EXHIBIT B**

**Support Terms**

Six CRM will provide Technical Support to Subscriber via both telephone and electronic mail on weekdays during the hours of 9:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, with the exclusion of Federal Holidays (&quot; **Support Hours** &quot;).
